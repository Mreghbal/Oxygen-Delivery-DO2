# Oxygen-Delivery-DO2
Python code for calculating the Oxygen Delivery (DO2) in actual conditions. However, please note that this code is provided for educational purposes and should be validated according to your specific requirements before using it in actual medical applications. Here's an example code
In this code, the calculate_do2 function takes two parameters: cardiac_output and arterial_oxygen_content. The cardiac_output represents the cardiac output in liters per minute (L/min), while arterial_oxygen_content represents the arterial oxygen content in milliliters of oxygen per deciliter of blood (mL/dL).

The function then calculates the oxygen delivery (DO2) by multiplying the cardiac output, arterial oxygen content, and a conversion factor of 10 (to convert mL/dL to mL/L).

Finally, we call the calculate_do2 function with example values, and the computed oxygen delivery is printed to the console.

Remember to adjust the input values according to your specific requirements.
